Here's a quick guide to set up your React Native project:

1 **Prerequisites:

Make sure you have Node.js installed on your machine. You can download it from the official website: https://nodejs.org
Install Expo CLI globally by running the following command in your terminal:
Copy code
npm install -g expo-cli
2 ***Clone the React Native project repository from GitHub:

Go to the repository page on GitHub (e.g., "my-react-native-app").

Click on the "Code" button and select the "HTTPS" option.

Copy the URL provided.

Open your terminal and navigate to the directory where you want to clone the project.

Run the following command to clone the repository:

bash
Copy code
git clone <repository-url>
  
3  *** Install project dependencies:

Navigate to the project directory using the terminal:

Copy code
cd my-react-native-app
Run the following command to install the project dependencies:

npm install
Start the development server:

Run the following command to start the Expo development server:

This will open the Expo DevTools in your browser and show a QR code in the terminal.
Set up your mobile device/emulator:

Install the Expo Go app on your mobile device from the App Store or Google Play Store.
Open the Expo Go app and scan the QR code displayed in the terminal or click on the provided links to open the app on your device/emulator.
Run the app:

Once the app is loaded on your mobile device/emulator, you should see your React Native app running.
Make any necessary modifications to the code, and the app will hot-reload and reflect the changes automatically.
That's it! You've successfully set up your React Native project and can now start developing your app.
